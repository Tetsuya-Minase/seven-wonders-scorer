# Documentation Generator

You are an expert technical writer tasked with generating comprehensive project documentation based on README.md content and orchestrator analysis results. Your goal is to create structured, detailed documentation in the docs directory that serves different stakeholders and use cases.

## Objective

Generate comprehensive project documentation with the following granularity:

1. **Functional Requirements** - Business requirements and feature specifications
2. **Technical Specifications** - Architecture and implementation details  
3. **Developer Guide** - Development environment setup and operational procedures
4. **API Specifications** - Endpoints and data formats
5. **Testing Documentation** - Test strategy and quality assurance

## Process Overview

### Phase 1: Pre-Analysis and Preparation

1. **Project Analysis Execution**
   - Execute `/project:orchestrator` command to gather project analysis
   - Read and parse README.md content
   - Review existing documentation structure
   - Identify project type and technology stack

2. **Documentation Strategy Determination**
   - Determine document structure based on project nature
   - Organize information by target audience (developers, architects, operators)
   - Define inter-document dependencies and relationships

### Phase 2: Document Generation

3. **Functional Requirements Generation** (`docs/requirements/functional-requirements.md`)
   - User stories and acceptance criteria
   - Feature list with priority levels
   - Business rules and constraints
   - User interface requirements
   - Integration requirements

4. **Technical Specifications Generation** (`docs/technical/architecture.md`)
   - System architecture overview
   - Component design and data flow
   - Technology selection rationale and alternatives
   - Security and performance requirements
   - Infrastructure and deployment considerations

5. **Developer Guide Generation** (`docs/development/developer-guide.md`)
   - Environment setup procedures
   - Coding standards and best practices
   - Debugging and troubleshooting procedures
   - Contribution guidelines
   - Development workflow

6. **API Specifications Generation** (`docs/api/api-specification.md`)
   - Endpoint details and parameters
   - Request/response formats
   - Error handling specifications
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Rate limiting and usage guidelines

7. **Testing Documentation Generation** (`docs/testing/test-strategy.md`)
   - Testing strategy and approach
   - Test case design methodology
   - Quality metrics and acceptance criteria
   - Continuous integration setup
   - Performance and security testing

### Phase 3: Document Integration and Optimization

8. **Navigation Structure Creation**
   - Generate document index (`docs/README.md`)
   - Set up cross-references and links
   - Implement searchable structure
   - Create quick navigation paths

9. **Quality Assurance and Review**
   - Content consistency verification
   - Link validation
   - Readability improvements
   - Diagram and code example optimization

```

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Gather Analysis Data
- Execute orchestrator command to get comprehensive project analysis
- Parse README.md for existing project information
- Review current codebase structure and patterns
- Identify key stakeholders and their documentation needs

### Step 2: Create Documentation Structure
- Create docs directory and subdirectories
- Set up templates for each document type
- Establish naming conventions and formatting standards

### Step 3: Generate Individual Documents
- Use analysis data to populate document templates
- Inject project-specific information and examples
- Create cross-reference links between documents
- Include relevant code snippets and diagrams

### Step 4: Create Index and Navigation
- Generate comprehensive docs/README.md
- Set up navigation between documents
- Create quick-start guides for different user types
- Add search and discovery mechanisms

## Quality Assurance Standards

- **Consistency**: Unified formatting and terminology across all documents
- **Completeness**: Comprehensive coverage without information gaps
- **Clarity**: Appropriate technical depth for target audience
- **Maintainability**: Easy-to-update structure and content organization
- **Accuracy**: Verified information with working examples

## Document Content Guidelines
